# AionTranslationsInComing
Here will be the translation of the aion 6.2 RU server both gamecoast and 4game

<h1>Note</h1>
<p>
A new version will consist to pack files again inside a data.pak so you will need only replacing the data.pak ( don't know if it's possible to do but will try it )
</p>
<h1>Warning</h1>
<p>Using this translation breaks a lot of the quest locating features. Normal /where works fine but using the locate button on the quest dialogs will usually return "Hard to find". Use Korean dialog in the mean time if you are questing.</p>

<p>Step 1: Click "Clone or download" <br>
Step 2: Open your Games\Aion PTS\L10N\RUS\Data. <br>
Step 3: Delete the ui and Strings folder only if they exist. <br>
Step 4: Open the downloaded AionTranslationsInComing.zip. <br>
Step 5: Open the main folder until you see multiple folders (ui/strings). Drag and drop that into the folder you just opened. <br>
Step 6: delete the data.pak. <br>
Step 7: Reopen Aion if you haven't already.</p> <br>
Step 8: Make sure to make a copy of your data.pak or each time you will open the game , the game will update itself .. So to prevent that before opening the web page to launch aion 4game make it back to the folder , delete it again if you see the button play on the webpage .
